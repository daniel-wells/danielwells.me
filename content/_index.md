I'm currently working at [Genomics plc](https://www.genomicsplc.com/precision-health/) developing statistical methods that use genetic data to estimate an individual's risk of various diseases.

Previously I completed a PhD in functional genomics at the University of Oxford, in which I used unsupervised statistical learning approaches to generate new scientific hypotheses and leads from high throughput genomics experiments ([thesis](https://github.com/daniel-wells/DPhil-Thesis)).
Prior to that I was an experimental molecular biologist with experience in a range of biomedical fields including vaccinology/immunology, developmental biology, genome engineering, and oncology.

Some specific projects I've worked on:
 - Creating an atlas of which genes are turned on in which cell types and at what stage during meiosis in mice. ([app](http://www.stats.ox.ac.uk/~wells/testisAtlas.html), [paper](https://elifesciences.org/articles/43966))
 - Characterisation of a specific gene that's required for successful meiosis in male mice. ([paper](https://doi.org/d5nm))
 - Creation and preclinical testing of vaccines for Ebola and MERS-Coronavirus (which went on to sucessfully complete phase I clinical trials in humans). ([paper](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41541-017-0029-1), [clinical trial paper](https://doi.org/ggtxgp))
 - Using CRISPR genetic editing to study the developmental process in chicken embryos. ([paper](https://doi.org/10.1242/dev.160333))
